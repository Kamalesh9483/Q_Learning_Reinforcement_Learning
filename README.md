# Q Learning / Reinforcement Learning
## This project is abput developing a pygame, where the agent explores the 4X4 grid environment, the target is the last row and last column, upon agent reaching the agent gets reward of +100 and there are fire in locations (1,1), (2,2), (3,2). The Q learning training is initially performed to learn the environment and update the Q table. Later while playing the game, when user inputs the row and column position of grid, the agent based on trained q table, will take optimum path to reach the target
